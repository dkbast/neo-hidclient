=============

Use the keyboard from your Linux computer to provide a bluetooth keyboard with the [neo-layout](http://neo-layout.org/) to a device that doesn't support the [neo-layout](http://neo-layout.org/) (for example an iOS-Device).

The base is [hidclient](http://anselm.hoffmeister.be/computer/hidclient/index.html.en) by Anselm Martin Hoffmeister (GPL License) and the [tweaks](https://github.com/benizi/hidclient) for [hidclient](http://anselm.hoffmeister.be/computer/hidclient/index.html.en) by Benjamin R. Haskell.


installation
